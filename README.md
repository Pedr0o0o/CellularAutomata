# CellularAutomata
the code supports various cellular automaton based methods and image manipulation

The implemented methods are:
* reading data from an image
* save the result as a .jpg file or as a .txt
* image binarization
* applying filters to the image:
* * high-pass
* * low pass
* * Gauss
in addition, the code includes methods implementing example methods based on cellular automata such as "game of life" and "forest fire"
